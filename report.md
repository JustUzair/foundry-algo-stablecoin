# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 42](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L42)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedStableCoin is ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 49](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 60](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```



## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 67](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L67)

	```solidity
	        _mint(_to, _amount);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 147](src/DSCEngine.sol#L147)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(_tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amountCollateral);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 175](src/DSCEngine.sol#L175)

	```solidity
	        bool success = i_dsc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 252](src/DSCEngine.sol#L252)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(_collateralTokenAddress).transfer(to, _collateralAmount);
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 26](src/DSCEngine.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 26](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```



## L-3: Conditional storage checks are not consistent

When writing `require` or `if` conditionals that check storage values, it is important to be consistent to prevent off-by-one errors. There are instances found where the same storage variable is checked multiple times, but the conditionals are not consistent.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 212](src/DSCEngine.sol#L212)

	```solidity
	        if (startingUserHealthFactor >= MIN_HEALTH_FACTOR) {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 227](src/DSCEngine.sol#L227)

	```solidity
	        uint256 bonusCollateral = (tokenAmountFromDebtCovered * LIQUIDATION_BONUS) / PRECISION;
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 241](src/DSCEngine.sol#L241)

	```solidity
	        return (amountUsdInWei * PRECISION) / (uint256(price) * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 284](src/DSCEngine.sol#L284)

	```solidity
	        return ((collateralAdjustedForThreshold * PRECISION) / totalDscMinted);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 289](src/DSCEngine.sol#L289)

	```solidity
	        if (userHealthFactor < MIN_HEALTH_FACTOR) {
	```



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 26](src/DSCEngine.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 26](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 49](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```



## NC-2: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 77](src/DSCEngine.sol#L77)

	```solidity
	    event CollateralDeposited(address indexed user, address indexed token, uint256 amount);
	```



## NC-3: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 143](src/DSCEngine.sol#L143)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 167](src/DSCEngine.sol#L167)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 173](src/DSCEngine.sol#L173)

	```solidity
	    function burnDSC(uint256 amount) public moreThanZero(amount) nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 186](src/DSCEngine.sol#L186)

	```solidity
	    function mintDSC(uint256 amountDscToMint) public moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
	```
